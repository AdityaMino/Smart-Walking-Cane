The systemâ€™s design is in such a way that the ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a servo motor to allow full 360-degree rotations so that in any direction an object/intruder approaches, the sensor would be able to detect the proximity. Once an object is detected, the system automatically emits a beeping sound, hence alerting the user of nearby objects
